# For Players
This plugin is a library, and does nothing to affect Beat Saber gameplay on its own. As long as you're running a vaguely recent version of BSIPA, everything should work fine. Please open an issue or reach out to Arti on the BSMG Discord if you get any exceptions/errors coming from CustomJSONData. (Please don't ask me about issues not related to my plugins. I didn't write the Darth Maul mod, so I don't know any more about it than you do. I don't know how to map songs or make 3D models.)

If you like the things other plugins are doing with the capabilities CustomJSONData provides, you can throw me a few dollars at <https://ko-fi.com/artibs>. If you want to support Beat Saber modders in general, check out <https://bsmg.wiki/about>.
